# SentinelLend Overview

## Objective

Build an isolated-market lending protocol that demonstrates production-grade protocol engineering and clear security thinking.

## Scope (v1)

- isolated collateral markets
- supply, borrow, repay, withdraw
- liquidation with bonus incentives
- oracle safety checks and stale-price protections
- guardian-controlled emergency pause

## Non-goals (v1)

- multi-collateral cross-margin accounts
- complex governance voting flows in initial MVP
- protocol tokenomics emissions

## Hiring-Focused Outcomes

This project should make it easy to evaluate:
- Solidity architecture and correctness
- security discipline under adversarial assumptions
- quality of protocol documentation and ops readiness
- ability to integrate smart contracts with off-chain agents and UI
